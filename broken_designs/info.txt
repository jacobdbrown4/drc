register_file will not pass the check because of the replicated cables

Codebreaker fully replicated has examples of possible bugs...several bugs
    plaintext_is_ascii ones are disconnected
    j_calc0_i_TMR_1 and 2 are partially driven by TMR_0's stuff
    data_out_b_reg_TMR_1 and 2 are not connected. No voters. But the non_leaf port is not replicated (probably because it's also disconnected?) so ignore?
    AND MORE....

stopwatch_no_buf
    - passed full
    - failed partial (segment and anodes were not connected. Segment port wasn't replicated and there were no voters inserted).
        Probably because what goes into segment and anode is voted on (and they're just LUT's) so we don't need voters?

debounce_no_buf
    - passed full
    - failed partial because of VCC
